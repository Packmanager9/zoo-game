<p>The red buttons on the right can be used to make pens and roads, which must touch a road, pens can't touch each other, and it's the green button to buy animals when you select a pen (clicking in the pen) to put them in. Also, 'r' as a hotkey to hold for roads (one side must be 1x wide) and 'q' for pens (pens must be 5x5 minimum). Overcrowded and lonely animals are much less entertaining, and guests won't like it as much. Press 'o' with a pen selected to sell animals. Press 'e' with a pen selected to sell enrichment. Hold G to see the grid, and use the text input box to change the background color. Hold 'y' to delete roads, and 'm' to sell selected exhibits or shops.</p>
